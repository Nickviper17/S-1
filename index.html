<h2>Back Story...
<br>
<br>
You are a professional cyclist. You bought a new cycle. Which is around 1 lack and 15 thousand. There is a good friend of yours. His name is Mithun. He is involved in dealing of stolen goods. In a week, there is a state level cycle race and you are going to take a part in that race. 
<br><br>
You went on a trip with your friends for three-four days and came back.
<br><br>
The next morning, you find that your cycle has been stolen by someone from your home. First you freak out, then you remember that you have a friend Mithun, who deals stolen goods and you decide to call him and ask if anyone had come to him and sold him a cycle in the past two to three days. He tells you that someone came to him and tried selling him a brand new cycle for a very cheap price. So, Mithun bought the cycle from him and then he sold it in four parts to four other people. Because, he didn’t know that was your cycle. Rest parts like brakes, mudguards, stand, etc. are with Mithun. He still has one part of the cycle that is the handle. You ask him to show you the handle. So, he comes to your house with a handle.  And you find out, that handle is your cycle's handle.
<br>
<br> 
Then you ask your friend that what were the four parts-
<br>
<br>
1.	Handle
<br>
2.	Chain Circuit
<br>
3.	Wheels
<br>
4.	Frame
<br>
5.	Seat
<br>
<br>
You have a handle.

Now, you have to find 4 other parts and make the cycle again.
